# bamazon

The basic mySQL assignment (server.js) should run properly. I had created a server.js for the assignment prior to reading the directions. server.js is equal to bamazonUser.js.

I've attached an images folder so you can see the program in action. The mySQL gatorade 
295/290 files are the before and after results of completing a purchase. There is also an image for what inquirer logs to show a successful purchase, a failed purchase, and how the initial application looks at startup. I tried linking them into the README file, but I couldn't get that to work either.

I *tried* completing the bamazonManager.js assignment, but got very lost when it came to the function values used. Calling responses inside of responses was a **very** challenging for me. I think the layout of the code in the bamazonManager.js file looks pretty organized... it just doesn't work entirely the way it's supposed to.
